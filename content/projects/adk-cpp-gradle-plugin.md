When I wanted to use brand new C++20 modules in my next project I found that currently (2021 Q3)
there is still no any support in major build systems typically used for C++ projects. So the 
obvious solution is to create one. This Gradle plugin satisfied all my needs for such a system and 
made me happy. More details in the repository.
